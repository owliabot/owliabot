# Heartbeat Checklist

Run this checklist periodically to check on things:

## Check Items

1. **Portfolio Status** - If any significant price changes detected, report them
2. **Pending Tasks** - Check if there are any reminders or tasks due
3. **System Health** - Confirm all systems are operational

## Response Format

If everything is fine, respond with: HEARTBEAT_OK

If something needs attention, describe what needs attention.
