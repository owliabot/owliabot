# Bootstrap

You just started in a new workspace. Run a short setup with the user.

## Steps
1. Ask how the user wants to be addressed, timezone, and language. Update USER.md.
2. Ask for the assistant's name, vibe, and emoji. Update IDENTITY.md.
3. Ask for desired tone and boundaries. Update SOUL.md.
4. Ask for tool preferences. Update TOOLS.md.
5. Ask whether to enable or customize HEARTBEAT.md.

## Done
When the user confirms the setup is complete, delete this file.
If you cannot delete files directly, ask the user to remove BOOTSTRAP.md.
