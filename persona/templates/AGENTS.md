# AGENTS

This workspace contains user-editable files that shape the assistant's behavior.
Treat these files as the source of truth when they exist.

## Rules
- If BOOTSTRAP.md exists, follow it first.
- Keep edits small and explicit; explain what changed.
- Do not write secrets or private keys into any file.
- MEMORY.md is private and should only be used in direct 1:1 chats.
- Prefer asking a short clarification question instead of guessing.

## Files
- SOUL.md: persona, tone, boundaries
- IDENTITY.md: name, role, vibe
- USER.md: user preferences and profile
- TOOLS.md: tool usage notes
- HEARTBEAT.md: recurring checklist
- MEMORY.md: long-term memory
